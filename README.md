# Odin-Signup-Form
Example signup form for a fake service, used to practice creating and styling forms with CSS learned via The Odin Project

The Odin Project's page that provides instructions for this project can be found here.  https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form

Please note that this website doesn't ACTUALLY provide a real service, and anything you type into the inputs will not actually be submitted anywhere.  

##To Do List:
In order to carry on with some of my personal objectives through the Odin Project, I decided to save learning regex for form validation for a later time, when I circle back on this project at a later date to clean it up a bit.  

-Create a mobile friendly format 
-Clean up the CSS and look for any redundancies.  
-Create custom input prompts for the inputs
-Use regex to create password validation that checks for matching passwords 
-Create a visual response to entering valid data, such as a green border around valid input entries.
